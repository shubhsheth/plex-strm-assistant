Enables `.strm` file playback in Plex. Plex dropped native `.strm` support, so this tool bridges the gap with two components:

![Plex Media Info showing proxy URL and H.264 direct play](docs/media-info.png)

- **strm-proxy**: a lightweight HTTP server that reads a `.strm` file and returns a `302` redirect to the URL inside it.
- **SQLite triggers**: installed once into the Plex database. Whenever Plex scans a `.strm` file, the trigger rewrites the stored path to a proxy URL (`http://strm-proxy:3000/...`). Rescans are handled automatically, so no re-patching is needed.

---

## Quick start (Docker Compose)

This is the recommended setup. Plex and the proxy run in the same Compose file and share a Docker network, so the proxy is reachable at `strm-proxy` without exposing an IP address.

**Prerequisites:** Docker with the Compose plugin.

### 1. Create the project folder

```bash
mkdir plex-strm && cd plex-strm
mkdir strm plex-config
```

- `strm/` holds your `.strm` files (see [.strm file format](#strm-file-format) below)
- `plex-config/` persists the Plex configuration and database

### 2. Create `docker-compose.yml`

All proxy settings have sensible defaults built into the image, so no environment configuration is needed for this layout:

```yaml
services:
  strm-proxy:
    image: liveinaus/plex-strm-assistant
    container_name: strm-proxy
    environment:
      - SKIP_SETUP=${SKIP_SETUP:-false}
    volumes:
      - ./strm:/strm:ro
      - ./plex-config:/plex-config
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    restart: unless-stopped

  plex:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/plex:latest
    container_name: plex
    ports:
      - '32400:32400'
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Australia/Sydney
      - VERSION=docker
      - PLEX_CLAIM=${PLEX_CLAIM:-}
    volumes:
      - ./plex-config:/config
      - ./strm:/media/strm:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
```

> **Tip:** to link Plex to your account, get a claim token from [plex.tv/claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim/) (valid for 4 minutes) and start with `PLEX_CLAIM=claim-xxxx docker compose up plex`.

### 3. Start Plex alone and let it initialise

Plex needs to create its database before the triggers can be installed:

```bash
docker compose up -d plex
```

Open `http://localhost:32400/web` and complete the initial setup wizard. Then stop Plex:

```bash
docker compose stop plex
```

> **Important:** Plex must be stopped for the next step. Writing to the Plex database while Plex is running risks database corruption.

### 4. Start the proxy to install the triggers

```bash
docker compose up strm-proxy
```

Wait for this output, which confirms the triggers are installed:

```text
strm-proxy | Setup complete. Plex rescans and new .strm files are now handled automatically.
strm-proxy | strm-proxy on :3000  root: /strm
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

### 5. Start everything

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

In Plex, add a library pointing at `/media/strm` and run a scan. Files will be playable immediately.

---

## .strm file format

Each `.strm` file contains a single HTTP/HTTPS URL:

```text
https://example.com/path/to/video.mp4
```

Organise them under `strm/` the same way you would real media files:

```text
strm/
  Movies/
    Big Buck Bunny (2008)/
      Big Buck Bunny (2008).strm
  TV Shows/
    Some Show/
      Season 01/
        Some Show - S01E01.strm
```

New `.strm` files are picked up automatically on the next Plex scan. No proxy restart is required.

---

## Restarting the proxy

The triggers only need to be installed once. To restart the proxy at any time without stopping Plex, set `SKIP_SETUP=true` so trigger installation is skipped:

```bash
SKIP_SETUP=true docker compose up -d strm-proxy
```

---

## Probing source metadata

By default Plex only gets the placeholder H.264/AAC pair the triggers seed, so items play immediately but show a single video + stereo audio track. The **probe pass** reads the real streams from each `.strm` source URL with `ffprobe` and writes accurate metadata into Plex: real video codec/resolution/frame rate, every audio track (codec, channels, language), embedded subtitle tracks, and duration. `ffmpeg` (which provides `ffprobe`) is bundled in the image.

It is safe to re-run: a signature of each source URL is stored, so unchanged files are skipped unless you pass `--force`. Any sidecar `.srt` streams Plex discovered are left untouched.

### Automatic (recommended): probe new files on an interval

Set `PROBE_INTERVAL` to a number of seconds and the container probes on that cadence. New `.strm` files play instantly on the placeholder, then upgrade to real metadata within one interval — the signature cache keeps each cycle cheap.

```yaml
services:
  strm-proxy:
    image: liveinaus/plex-strm-assistant
    environment:
      - PROBE_INTERVAL=1800 # probe every 30 minutes
    # ...volumes/ports as in the Quick start
```

> This writes to the Plex database while Plex is running. SQLite's WAL locking (with a busy timeout) serialises those writes safely. If you would rather never write to a running database, leave `PROBE_INTERVAL` unset and use the manual run below with Plex stopped.

### Manual (one-off) run

Run the probe pass on demand — for example the first time, or after adding a batch of files. As with trigger installation, stopping Plex first avoids writing to a running database:

```bash
docker compose run --rm strm-proxy \
  node --experimental-sqlite /app/dist/probe-cli.js \
    --db "$DB_PATH" \
    --scan-strm /strm \
    --rebase /strm:/media/strm \
    --proxy-base http://strm-proxy:3000
```

Useful flags:

| Flag                 | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dry-run`          | Report what would change without writing to the database          |
| `--force`            | Re-probe every file, even ones whose source URL hasn't changed    |
| `--concurrency <n>`  | How many URLs to probe in parallel (default `3`)                  |
| `--probe-timeout <ms>` | Per-URL `ffprobe` timeout in milliseconds (default `30000`)     |
| `--ffprobe-path <p>` | Path to the `ffprobe` binary (default `ffprobe`)                  |

> The probe pass depends on Plex having already scanned the `.strm` file (so the `media_parts` row exists). Files Plex hasn't scanned yet are reported as `NOT IN DB` and picked up on a later run.

## Configuration

All variables are optional. The defaults match the Quick start layout, so you only need these if your mount paths or hostnames differ.

| Variable           | Default                                                                                                               | Description                                                             |

| `STRM_PROXY_HOST`  | `strm-proxy`                                                                                                          | Hostname used in proxy URLs stored in the Plex DB                       |

## Alternative setups

### Standalone (Plex runs elsewhere)

If Plex is already running outside of Docker Compose, run the proxy on its own. Set `STRM_PROXY_HOST` to a hostname or IP reachable by both the Plex server and your Plex clients. The first-run order still applies: stop Plex before the first start of the proxy so the triggers can be installed safely.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name strm-proxy \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/your/strm:/strm:ro \
  -v /path/to/plex/config:/plex-config \
  -e STRM_PROXY_HOST=<hostname-or-ip> \
  liveinaus/plex-strm-assistant
```

### Multiple `.strm` directories

If your `.strm` files live in separate directories, mount each one as a subdirectory under `/strm`. The trigger matches everything under the prefix recursively, so no code changes are needed.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name strm-proxy \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/movies-strm:/strm/Movies:ro \
  -v /path/to/tv-strm:/strm/TV:ro \
  -v /path/to/plex/config:/plex-config \
  -e STRM_PROXY_HOST=<hostname-or-ip> \
  liveinaus/plex-strm-assistant
```

Mount the same directories into Plex under `/media/strm/Movies` and `/media/strm/TV` respectively so the paths align.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy logs "Waiting for Plex DB"

The proxy could not find the Plex database at `DB_PATH`. Make sure Plex has been started at least once (step 3 of the Quick start) and that the Plex config directory is mounted at `/plex-config` in the proxy container.

### Embedded subtitles or extra audio tracks are missing

Plex is not given real stream data for a remote URL, so the triggers seed a placeholder H.264/AAC pair to keep direct play working immediately. That placeholder describes one video and one stereo audio track only, so embedded subtitle and secondary audio tracks do not appear on their own.

To publish the **real** tracks (all audio, embedded subtitles, accurate resolution/codec/duration), run the probe pass — see [Probing source metadata](#probing-source-metadata). It replaces the placeholder with real per-track metadata read from the source with `ffprobe`.

Sidecar subtitles also work: put a `.srt` next to the `.strm` with a matching base name (`Movie (2008).strm` and `Movie (2008).en.srt`) and rescan the library. Both the triggers and the probe pass leave any stream Plex discovers (sidecars included) in place.

### "Database disk image is malformed"

If Plex reports this, recover the database:

```bash
# Stop Plex first
DB="/path/to/plex/config/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Databases/com.plexapp.plugins.library.db"
sqlite3 "$DB" ".recover" | sqlite3 "${DB}.fresh"
mv "$DB" "${DB}.dead" && mv "${DB}.fresh" "$DB"
rm -f "${DB}-wal" "${DB}-shm"
# Start Plex again
```

## Roadmap

- [x] HTTP proxy that resolves `.strm` files to stream URLs via `302` redirect
- [x] SQLite triggers to survive Plex rescans automatically
- [x] Inject H.264/AAC codec metadata to force direct play (no transcoding)
- [x] Docker container that installs triggers on start, then runs the proxy
- [x] Multi-platform image (amd64, arm64)
- [x] Safe first-run handling: waits for the Plex DB, `SKIP_SETUP` flag for restarts
- [ ] Disable unnecessary Plex processing on `.strm` items (analysis, thumbnail generation, etc.)
- [x] Probe source URLs (ffprobe) to publish real video, audio and subtitle track metadata to Plex
- [ ] Follow 302 redirects from the source URL before returning to Plex, enabling compatibility with services that require a redirect step (e.g. 115 Drive)
